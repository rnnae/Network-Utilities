# Network-Utilities
A comprehensive C library designed for network infrastructure and educational purposes. Developed as part of my undergraduate thesis project (TCC), this library provides tools for handling IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, CIDR calculations, subnetting, routing, traffic diagnostics and more. Compatible with both Linux and Windows.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use it in your projects!

To compile the library with GCC - "gcc -shared -o libnetworkutils.dll network_utils.c -fPIC -lm -lgmp -lws2_32"
